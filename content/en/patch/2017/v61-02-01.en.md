## Update

### **1.** Dungeon
- Decreased difficulty of Thaumetal Refinery (hard)
  - Decreased damage of certain skills for each boss
  - Increased stun duration of 1st boss after tackling tree
  - Decreased penalty / damage of explosive goblins during 3rd boss

```
Developer comment (paraphrased; point form)

- Too many players were trying to take advantage of the market by obtaining tradeable items from Entropic / Metamorphic Emblem and eventually trading Gold for real money so they changed items to be untradeable.
- Existing old materials are still tradeable, but
- Remakes of old materials that are untradeable replace the tradeable ones in the Entropic / Metamorphic Emblem shops
- Existing old materials will now dismantle to Mark of Change instead of Token of Change
- Increased gold reward from Vanguard Iniative quest due to difficulty enchanting
```
