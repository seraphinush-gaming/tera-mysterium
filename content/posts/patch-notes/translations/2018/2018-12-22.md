### 1. Balance
- Adjusted to increase XP on ilvl 412-456 dungeon bosses
  - Changed XP ranges differently per dungeon
- Decreased XP required to level up between level 66-70

Developer comment
- First off we increased XP earned through dungeons by 3 times through this maintenance. The XP gain has been adjusted using difficulty and clear time as basis, and therefore each each dungeon provides a different amount of XP. We are looking into more ways to provide XP.

### Bug fixes
- Fixed issue where Joy of Partying effect did not apply in Dark Reaches Citadel (hard) (7-man), Antaroth's Abyss (hard) (7-man), and Grotto of Lost Souls (hard) (7-man)
- Fixed issue where basic flying mount skill book earned from story quest could not be destroyed
- Fixed issue where field boss monster's reward box occasionally did not drop when defeated by a raid
- Fixed issue where PC Bang items could not be destroyed nor stored in bank
- Fixed issue where Orcan boxes would provide a large sum of XP
- Fixed issue where defeating Revived Tree BAMs would count towards boss monster kill achievement
- Fixed issue where Ninjas and Sorcerers did not receive Crit Power increase from VIP Prime Battle Nostrum
