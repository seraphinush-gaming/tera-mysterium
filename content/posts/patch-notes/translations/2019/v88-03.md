```
### 1. Halloween event (K TERA exclusive)
- Significantly decreased number of fake Gourdos
- Removed Frontera from spawn locations for Gourdos
  - Due to issue where too many spawned in areas that could not be accessed
- Removed Gourdos Moongourd x2 from drop table, and adjusted drop rate of other items
  - Significantly increased the drop rate of Gourdos Moongourd x5

### Bug fixes
- Fixed issue where Halloween-themed style items disappeared upon entering dungeon/battlergound
  - Items lost due to this issue will be restored
