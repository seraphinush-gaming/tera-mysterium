- Animation
  - Fixed issue where players or NPC being airborne after using an airborne skill could not move their character

Developer comment
- The above issue is confirmed to have the same cause as to the issue where players got stuck on ladders and could not move in Corsair's Stronghold. By fixing this bug, we believe this will fix the issue in Corsair's Stronghold as well, and we will continue to monitor in case any other problems arise.
