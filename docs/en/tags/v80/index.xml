      <description>1. Balance  Adjusted to increase XP on ilvl 412-456 dungeon bosses  Changed XP ranges differently per dungeon   Decreased XP required to level up between level 66-70  Developer comment
 First off we increased XP earned through dungeons by 3 times through this maintenance. The XP gain has been adjusted using difficulty and clear time as basis, and therefore each each dungeon provides a different amount of XP.</description>
