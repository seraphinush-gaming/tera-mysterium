      <description>Update 1. Dungeon  Decreased difficulty of Thaumetal Refinery (hard)  Decreased damage of certain skills for each boss Increased stun duration of 1st boss after tackling tree Decreased penalty / damage of explosive goblins during 3rd boss    Developer comment (paraphrased; point form) - Too many players were trying to take advantage of the market by obtaining tradeable items from Entropic / Metamorphic Emblem and eventually trading Gold for real money so they changed items to be untradeable.</description>
