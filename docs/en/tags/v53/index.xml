      <description>1. Skill  Berserker  Vampiric Strike, Lethal Strike Revised issue where damage was significantly low at high HP  The following is the HP and damage ratio: HP 100-90%: 1.0 times, HP 90-80%: 1.1 times Damage onward will increase by 1.1 times per 10% HP (Max at HP 10-0%: 2.0 times) Note: Probably means that each decremenet of 10% HP will result in “additional” 0.1 times damage.     Slayer  Knockdown Strike  Changed so that Knockdown Strike can be chained from the 1st and 2nd hit of Distant Blade as well Fixed issue where casting speed of Knockdown Strike was significant faster than intended     Lancer  Backstep  Changed animation to take effect from Attack Speed, while making the iframe last just before the end of the animation static      2.</description>
