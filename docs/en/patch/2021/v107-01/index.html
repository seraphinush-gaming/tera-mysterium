Addition update on new gear release together with a class balance is in preparation. key detail in preparation is, for each class, stat-related passive revision, skill damage and effect adjustment, and select skill revision and addition. through these changes, we hope to match the necessary balance between classes that were not applied in this balance update, so please stay tuned for more information.

<pre><code>Developer comment

Unleash-related skill and Bloodlust skill adjustments
- Regarding the Berserker class, we realized there was a risk due to the lack of utility while using Unleash, especially in the current meta where frequency repositioning is necessary. with this in mind, the purpose of the above adjustments was to leverage some of the risks and reinforce. in addition, a new movement skill will be added in a future update in order to be able to adjust to the current meta better.

Flatten, Vampiric Blow, Tackle adjustments
- Skill damage increase adjustments were focused on skills that have low usage relative to other main skills in order to gradually even out balance between skills.

Cyclone adjustments on stagger effect against players
- Due to the constant stagger effect applied from repeated usage of Cyclone, it makes it hard for players to deal with, allowing the user to take control of the area quite easily. therefore, we hope that removing the stagger effect on the last hit will give other players room to react.

또한 향후 업데이트에서 패시브 및 스킬 조정을 통해 스텟을 통한 성장 체감이 보다 잘 발생하도록 개선될 예정입니다.

Stat increase skill effect and Blade Frenzy skill damage adjustment
- Regarding the Warrior class, we felt that they were slightly weaker in boss fights compared to other classes, and was difficult to see the effect from the key passive skill. through this update we adjusted select skill effects to increase the overall dps against monsters. 차후 업데이트에서는 스텟을 통한 성장 체감이 보다 잘 발생할 수 있도록 치명상 패시브의 개선이 이루어질 예정입니다.

Backstab stun duration adjustment
- While in Warrior's Defensive Stance, players can easily chain the long stun status displaying a strong stance in a 1:1 situation. therefore, we hope that decreasing the stun duration will give other players room to react.

Ice Lance, Fusion enhancement requirement and passive effect adjustment
- Regarding the Sorcerer class, we felt that they were slightly weaker in boss fights compared to other classes, and especially difficult for players with low proficiency. with this in mind, adjusting skill requirements of skills that require high proficiency will close the class proficiency gap, and strengthening the passive effect will increase the overall dps. 향후 업데이트에서는, 패시브 및 스킬 조정을 통해 스텟을 통한 성장체감이 보다 잘 발생하도록 개선될 예정입니다.

Regarding the archer class discomfort due to Rapid Fire cutting short has been consistently occuring. this has been confirmed to be a structural issue, and we are preparing to make revisions in a future update. through this update we hoped to lower class complexity by making it easier to use without having to check for Sequential Fire cooldown reset.

<pre><code>Developer comment

Propulsion passive requirement adjustment
- The existing 'decrease cooldown of Measured Slice after a critical hit of Eviscerate' effect is a big factor in affecting class complexity, due to skill rotation change on whether or not a critical hit is activated. in order to decrease class complexity, the effect's requirement was adjusted to focus more on [] than the target's action during combat.

<pre><code>Developer comment

Binding Scythes usage, and cooldown, skill damage adjustment
- Skill complexity was high due to the long period to apply damage and the number of successful hits to make in order to utilize 100% of the skill, and difficulty to use properly depending on the boss monster's mechanics. with this in mind, the final hit damage time and effect was adjusted to make it easier to utilize the skill than before, upon choosing the right time to cast. in addition, cooldown duration was adjusted in order to help match Binding Scythes usage with other key buffs. however, as Reapers are already displaying an outstanding performance the skill damage was adjusted as well.

<pre><code>Developer comment

Synergetic dps role reduction
- The synergetic dps concept through Armorbreak effect on Twilight Waltz does not trigger a meaningful play in the current meta, and taking in the fact that party clear times were relatively faster with a Valkyrie in the party, we decided to remove Armorbreak effect and increase Valkyrie performance in turn. Notably, Dreamblaze passive effect and skill damage of Glaive Strike, Ground Bash was adjusted to make non-ultimate duration play be more meaningful than before.

Harmonious Burning Heart hit method adjustment
- Regarding Harmonious Burning Heart, discomfort due to clone-based Burning Heart missing hits depending on the size of the target has been occuring. with this in mind, hit method has been revised to not be altered depending on the size of the target, and effectively hit from a distance. however, as it become much easier to target, damage to players has been adjusted to prevent damage excessively.

Triumphant Shout, Tenacity skill effect adjustment
- We noticed Triumphant Shout, Tenacity that uptime was high during combat, leaving little time for the opponent to react and diminished the urgency combat should have. with this in mind, effect duration was adjusted to make exchanges with the opponent more frequent by being more vigilant in using the above skills.
- Regarding the Slayer class, an upperhand was easily gained in combat against players through various effects received from '' Skill Optimization (immunity, status resistance, and status removal). therefore, for choosing '' Skill Optimization for PVP means, the effect was adjusted to select few effects.
