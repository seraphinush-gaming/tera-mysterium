      <description>Companion Pets and Partners together are called Companions, and are support creatures players can summon to help you with your gameplay. In the past, Companions were simply Pets that you can summon from your Skill UI. From v81 and onward, Pets are accessed from Companion UI, with the addition of Partners. Pets that have special Pet Skills can perform tedious tasks such as looting drop items, looting gold, gathering resources, or providing extra storage.</description>
