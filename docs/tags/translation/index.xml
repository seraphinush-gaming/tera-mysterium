      <description>1. Dungeon   Adjusted Destroyed Gateway to God&amp;rsquo;s Realm balance.
 Phase 3  Increased Vergoth defense Increased center breathe damage Increased HP of attribute sphere Increased attribute sphere explosion damage Increased HP of shield for all body parts Increased periodic damage of lava puddle Increased defense upon burn phase      Developer&amp;rsquo;s comment: We have confirmed that phase 3 severely lacks difficulty. Because of this, clearing phase 3 has become meaningless, and it does not accomplish its role as a bridge to phase 4, and thus the difficulty of the phase was significantly increased.</description>
