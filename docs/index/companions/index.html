    <h1><a href="https://seraphinush-gaming.com/index/companions/">Companions</a></h1>
    <p> Jan 1, 0001 </p>
    <h1 id="companion">Companion</h1>
<p><strong>Pets</strong> and <strong>Partners</strong> together are called Companions, and are support creatures players can summon to help you with your gameplay. In the past, Companions were simply Pets that you can summon from your Skill UI. From v81 and onward, Pets are accessed from Companion UI, with the addition of Partners. Pets that have special <strong>Pet Skills</strong> can perform tedious tasks such as looting drop items, looting gold, gathering resources, or providing extra storage.</p>
<p>Pets can grow and level up by feeding them Talents, Feedstock, and various food items. Once a Pet grows to Level 10, it can use an <strong>Evolution Core</strong> for a chance to evolve into a random Partner. Failure to do so drops its level down to Level 9, and you&rsquo;ll need to feed it again back to Level 10. Two Pets can also be <strong>combined</strong> to become a random Pet, or even a random Partner at a low chance. The higher the grades of the Pets, the more likely it is for the two to be combined into a Partner. Note that combining two Grade 10 Pets is guaranteed to become a random Partner. Evolving or Combining Pets will lose their Pet Skills.</p>
<p><strong>Partners</strong> are specialized Companions. What makes Partners most valuable is their <strong>Bond Skill</strong>, which provides valuable combat support. Partners also have one random <strong>Gifted Skills</strong> that work passively depending on how much Stamina the Partner has. Partners can <strong>Train</strong> to take and learn Pet Skills from different Companions, so make sure to take Pet Skills from Pets before Evolving or Combining Pets.</p>
<p>Partners start at Grade 1 and Fellowship 1 and can be <strong>Promoted</strong> by consuming another Partner. Promoting a Partner increases its Grade by 1, and improves Fellowship by a random value. Partners cannot go past Grade 10, and therefore can only be promoted 9 times.</p>
<p>At level 66, you can get your first Partner from <strong>Hatching a Partner</strong> quest given by Loomey the Wanderering Scholar in Highwatch. While the obtained Partner does not gain more Fellowship from being Promoted, it can be used to promote another Partner.</p>
<h1 id="fellowship">Fellowship</h1>
<p>Fellowship is what determines how effective your Partner&rsquo;s <strong>Bond Skill</strong> is. By promoting your Partner, Fellowship of your Partner can increase. While Fellowship caps at 50, the amount of Fellowship increased at each Promotion varies depending on the Grade of the sacrificed Partner.</p>
<p>The obtained Fellowship for a Partner is of the following :

<p>While heavily dependent on RNG, it is highly recommended to Promote a Partner sacrificing Grade 8 or higher Partners in order to maximize the potential Fellowship gain.</p>
<h1 id="bond-skill--power">Bond skill : Power</h1>
<p>Select Partners can provide Power for their Bond Skill. Depending on the rarity of your Partner and how high your Partner&rsquo;s Fellowship is, the effectiveness of the skill as well as its duration varies. Four Partners &ndash; <strong>Marie</strong>, <strong>Kuncun</strong>, <strong>Cocomin</strong>, and <strong>Loo</strong> &ndash; have been released to have <strong>Bracing Force</strong> for their Bond Skill, which increases Power for a set duration of time.</p>
<p>The obtained Power and its duration for a Partner of Uncommon, Rare, and Superior rarity is of the following :

<h1 id="bond-skill--amplification">Bond skill : Amplification</h1>
<p>Select Partners can provide Amplification for its Bond Skill. Depending on the rarity of your Partner and how high your Partner&rsquo;s Fellowship is, the effectiveness of the skill as well as its duration varies. Two Partners &ndash; <strong>Pico</strong>  and <strong>Eco</strong> &ndash; have been released to have <strong>Robust Energy</strong> and <strong>Vibrant Energy</strong> for their Bond Skill, which increases Physical Amplification and Magical Amplication (respectively) for a set duration of time.</p>
<p>The obtained Physical / Magical Amplification and its duration for a Partner of Uncommon, Rare, and Superior rarity is of the following :

<h1 id="gifted-skill">Gifted Skill</h1>
<p>Gifted Skills are specialized Partner skills that and each Partner is restricted to a set of Gifted Skills.
