Reward change comment
- Despite our intention for unskilled new and returning players to be self-sufficient through solo contents, it seems as though players were forced to harvest enchanting materials from multiple characters for one character. by neglecting this problem, we believed that it may disencourage playing as a party and disrupt the economy, and thus have decided to proceed with adjusting the rewards of most of the content. as a result, we hope that playing either solo content or dungeon content will both be equally rewarding, and will plan during content such that rewards given will not mkae users to disregard one content for another.
